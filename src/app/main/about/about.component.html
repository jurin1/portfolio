          Hi, I am a Front End Developer based in Gronau, Germany. I have
          experience in building webapps with JavaScript and Angular. I would
          like to further develop my skills and am looking forward to a
          professional career as a developer. I have responsive web apps,
          business apps, and a game in my portfolio. Feel free to try them out.

              Even as a child I found IT and programming very interesting and
              bought my first HTML book at the age of 13. Unfortunately, I
              didn't find an apprenticeship in IT after school and then moved
              into other industries. Now I have decided to become a programmer
              to turn my love of technology, IT, and software into a career
            </p>

            <p>
              Due to my love of IT and programming, I feel at home in the
              industry. My passion for innovative technologies and my
              willingness to continuously learn make me a dedicated team member
              who always strives to find elegant solutions to complex
              challenges. My understanding of abstract relationships and how
              computers work makes me the perfect employee.
